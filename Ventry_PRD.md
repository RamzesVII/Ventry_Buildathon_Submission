# Ventry – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Summary

**Name:** Ventry  
**Tagline:** Monetize your IP. Your Way.  
**Type:** Web3 platform for IP subscription and licensing  
**Protocol Base:** Story Protocol

Ventry enables creators to monetize their intellectual property (IP) through two main models:
1. Subscription Vaults – fans pay to access content via Stripe, USDC, or NFTs.
2. Licensing Vaults – marketers license content for commercial use under fixed or usage-based terms.
