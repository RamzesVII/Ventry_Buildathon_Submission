# Ventry â€“ Creator-First IP Monetization Platform

Ventry is a Web3-native platform for creators to monetize their intellectual property using Story Protocol.  
It offers two core monetization models:

1. **Subscription Vaults** â€“ Fans pay monthly to access exclusive content (comics, art, stories, etc.).
2. **Licensing Vaults** â€“ Marketers and creators can license IP for commercial use with fixed or usage-based terms.
